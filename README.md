Welcome to my To-Do List Project! This is a simple, interactive to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is designed to help users manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and marking them as completed. It's an excellent demonstration of my front-end development skills and JavaScript functionality.
